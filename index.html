            <h1>To my dearest <span class="title"></span> <span class="name"></span> </h1>
            <p>
              Its been several fortnights since ive seen you last.

              <hr>

              nary have the days past and new changes it beckons with it. Timothy and Gertrude still play in the field,
              though, little clarence met the maker do to a tragic wheat thrasher tragedy I think the children are learning to play again.
              
              Have you heard the news This splendid new invention called the light bulb was created a few nights ago, agatha is sure that it is the devil at work as always!

              Recently I saw Betty Sue; She was not wearing her bonnet.
              
              So a group of us curch folk are going to throw wood crucifixes at her until she repents.

              O I dear say my sweet <span class="name"></span> that I believe that I have contracted the yellow fever.

              I fear by the time you read this I will have been dead for <span class="days"></span> Days

              Please respect my final wishes and be sure to use every part of horses as Im sure no one has fed them, and when you bury me be sure to remove my arms, place them in a cross on my chest, drive a steak through my heart and nail my coffin shut so I don't come back as a vampire to feed upon those I loved in life.

              <hr>

              <span class="formality"></span> yours...
